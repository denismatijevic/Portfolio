# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
/* HEADER */
In this project I've created a responsive portfolio. 
The portfolio consists of three different tabs, which all work and you can switch back and fourth between them
The about me includes a picture of me and a description of who I am. 
The portfolio tab includes links to my github and my linkedin.
The contact tab includes a place for a name, email and a message. 
I used HTML and CSS to complete this project. I utilzed bootstrap as well.
Along with a lot of "google fu"
